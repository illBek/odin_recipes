    <h1>Welcome to Bek's Recipes!</h1>

    <h2>Who am I</h2>

    <p>A self-taught food lover and cook,<strong>European</strong>background, sweet-tooth,<strong>sourdough pizza</strong>-lover.</p>

    <h2>About the recipes</h2>

    <p>My <a href=./pages/recipes.html>recipes</a> follow a few principles:
        <ul>
            <li>Made with organic ingredients,</li>
            <li>Healthy,</li>
            <li>Outright delicious,</li>
            <li>Easy to follow.</li>
        </ul> 
    I believe everyone can cook. Saying "I am not good at cooking" or "I can't cook" simply means that you are too lazy to grab a knife or pan and prepare your own food.</p>

    <h2>Why cooking?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Research has shown that buying pre-cooked food, rather than cooking with primary ingredients, increases the chance of literally every single disease you can think of.</li>
            <li>You can decide how much sugar and salt you add based on your taste. My recipes, for example, are naturally low in salt and sugar - it takes a bit of adjusting, but it's worth it!</li>
            <li>It's fun! Play some music while you are at it - it decreases stress and increases wellbeing.</li>
