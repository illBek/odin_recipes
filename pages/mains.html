    <h1>Mains Options</h1>

    <ol>
        <li><h2>Lasagne<em> - yes, it ends with an "e"!</em></h2></li>
            <img src="../images/lasagne.jpg" alt="A mouth-watering slice of lasagne" width="350">

            <p>Lasagne are the savoury version of tiramisu. Substitute <i>savoiardi</i> for pasta sheets, <i>mascarpone</i> cream for ragu', and sprinkle <i>parmigiano reggiano</i> instead of cacao powder. The result is paradise on earth that melts in your mouth. If done properly, it is legendary. Welcome to Lasagne!</p>
             <ul><h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                <li>300g flour</li>
                <li>60g coconut sugar</li>
                <li>1 flax egg (2 tbsp water, 1 tbsp ground flaxseed)</li>
                <li>50 ml coconut/olive oil</li>
                <li>3 apples</li>
                <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
                <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 lemon - juice and rind</li>
                <li>cinnamon - to taste</li>
                <li>100ml vegetable milk (approx)</li>
            </ul>

            <ol><h3>Process:</h3>
                <li>In a bowl, add 2 tablespoons of water and 1 of ground flaxseed to create a flag egg. Let it rest for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Slice 2 apples and turn them into a pulp (with a food processor).</li>
                <li>Slice thinly the other apple.</li>
                <li>Once the 5 minutes have passed, add the apple sauce, vanilla extract, lemon juice, vegetable oil to the bowl.</li>
                <li>Whisk briefly.</li>
                <li>Now add the lemon grated rind, the cinnamon, the baking powder, the coconut sugar and the eggs.</li>
                <li>Combine until homogeneous.</li>
                <li>Lastly, add the apples slices and the milk (not necessarily 100ml - if shouldn't be too liquid!) and mix again.</li>
                <li>Pour in a 20cm cake pan and place in the oven at 180* for about 35 minutes. Test with a toothpick before turning off the oven.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
            </ol>

                <p>Pizza hardly needs an introduction: it's the fancy version of a <i>bruschetta</i>, with added mozzarella. A pizza a day doesn't take the doctor away, but it makes you happy like nothing else. The following recipe is perfect for both normal ovens and pizza ovens.</p>
                <ul><h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                    <li>100g buckwheat flour</li>

                    <li>60g coconut sugar</li>
                    <li>30ml coconut oil</li>
                    <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>75ml vegetable milk (approx)</li>
                </ul>

                <ol><h3>Process:</h3>
                    <li>In a bowl, add all the solid ingredients, followed by the liquid ingredients.</li>
                    <li>Once happy with the consistency (they should be runny but not liquid, able to keep the shape in the pan) warm up a pan and melt some coconut oil.</li>
                    <li>Pour 1 fat tablespoon of batter onto the hot pan, cover and let it cook until bubbles appear - after which turn them and let them cook on the other side as well.</li>
                    <li>Once enough of them are ready, eat with a sprinkle of soy yogurt, some seasonal fruit and some maple / coconut syrup.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Pizzoccheri are best eaten in winter - they are a hearty dish. They are also best eaten when you do not have cholesterol problems - if you are young, healthy and you can spare a few veins, then be prepared to be mind- and palate- blown by this Northern-Italian specialty.</p>
