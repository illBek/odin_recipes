        <li><h2>Tiramisu</h2></li>

            <h3>Description:</h3> 
            <p>Tiramisu is every person's favorite dessert (not yours? Stop lying). It is a layered cake, the structure of which is made with a special kind of biscuits (<i>savoiardi</i>), dipped in coffee (which gives it its name, literally, "pick me up"). A luxurious cream made by eggs, sugar and <i>mascarpone</i> is its binding element. Cacao powder should usually sprinkled on top, because why not?</p>

            <ul><h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                <li>400g savoiardi</li>
                <li>6 eggs - at room temperature</li>
                <li>500g mascarpone</li>
                <li>100g sugar</li>
                <li>cacao powder</li>
                <li>coffee (approximately 2 cups)</li>
                <li>a pinch of salt</li>
            </ul>

            <ol><h3>Process:</h3>
                <li>Prepare the coffee - then let it cool at the bottom of a soup plate. You should be able to dip the <i>savoiardi</i> in it.</li>
                <li>Separate egg yolks from egg whites.</li>
                <li>Pour half of the total sugar into the bowl containing the egg yolks, then whisk until clear and bubbly.</li>
                <li>Add the <i>mascarpone</i> to the egg yolks + sugar mixture. Mix until well combined.</li>
                <li>Clean the whisk really well. After which, add a pinch of salt to the bowl containing the egg whites, add some of the remaining sugar and start whisking. Add some more sugar after a while, and finish it off after some more time.</li>
                <li>When the above is super firm (it shouldn't fall off the whisk when lifted), add some to the <i>mascarpone</i> mixture, mix it in, then add the remaining in separate tranches, mixing from top to bottom and incorporating it delicately.</li>
                <li>When the whole cream is homogeneous and absolutely delicious, you can start putting it all together. It shouldn't be liquid - soggy and liquid-y tiramisu are the worst!</li>
                <li>In an oven pan, spread a tablespoon of cream at the bottom. Then dip the <i>savoiardi</i> (half way, otherwise they become too soggy) and lay them flat covering the whole oven pan.</li>
                <li>Add a generous portion of the cream on top - nobody likes dry tiramisu either! Then sprinkle with cacao powder.</li>
                <li>Repeat until you run out of cream or savoiardi. With these quantities, you should be able to do 2/3 layers of a 35cm x 18cm oven pan (approximately).</li>
                <li>Let it rest, in the fridge, for at least 6 hours before eating (overnight, possibly. A full day if you really love food). Finish it within 3 days - it shouldn't be a problem, really.</li>
            </ol>
