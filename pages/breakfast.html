                <li>300g flour</li>
                <li>60g coconut sugar</li>
                <li>1 flax egg (2 tbsp water, 1 tbsp ground flaxseed)</li>
                <li>50 ml coconut/olive oil</li>
                <li>3 apples</li>

            <ol><h3>Process:</h3>
                <li>In a bowl, add 2 tablespoons of water and 1 of ground flaxseed to create a flag egg. Let it rest for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Slice 2 apples and turn them into a pulp (with a food processor).</li>
                <li>Slice thinly the other apple.</li>
                <li>Once the 5 minutes have passed, add the apple sauce, vanilla extract, lemon juice, vegetable oil to the bowl.</li>
                <li>Whisk briefly.</li>
                <li>Now add the lemon grated rind, the cinnamon, the baking powder, the coconut sugar and the eggs.</li>
                <li>Combine until homogeneous.</li>
                <li>Lastly, add the apples slices and the milk (not necessarily 100ml - if shouldn't be too liquid!) and mix again.</li>
                <li>Pour in a 20cm cake pan and place in the oven at 180* for about 35 minutes. Test with a toothpick before turning off the oven.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
            </ol>

                    <li>Once happy with the consistency (they should be runny but not liquid, able to keep the shape in the pan) warm up a pan and melt some coconut oil.</li>
                    <li>Pour 1 fat tablespoon of batter onto the hot pan, cover and let it cook until bubbles appear - after which turn them and let them cook on the other side as well.</li>
